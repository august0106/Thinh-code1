                    Here is an up-to-date book that ably documents existing knowledge pertaining to the biology and
                    evolution of dinosaurs. The volume is both attractive and well-designed. A forward was contributed
                    by Philip Currie, dinosaur expert extraordinaire, and the subject matter was reviewed by colleagues
                    familiar with Mesozoic fossil fields around the world. Emphasis is unabashedly focused on dinosaurs.
                    Restorations by Michael Skrepnick grace the volume, and the text is creative, fresh, and folksy.
                    Indeed, the chapter headings are so creative that they tend to obscure the progression in thought.
                    (Original chapter headings, sequentially, are as folows: Treasure Island, Stardust saurians,
                    Dramatus dinosaurae, Drifting continents, Solar eating, River of life, Green gradient, Panoply of
                    predators, Hidden strands, Horn-heads and duckbills, Goldilocks hypothesis, Cinderellasaurus,
                    Jurassic Park dreams, West Side Story, and The way of all creatures.) Alternative headings arranged
                    in sequence could read: Discovery, Place in time, Relationships, Plate tectonics, Solar energy,
                    Evolution, Vegetation and feeding, Carnivorous dinosaurs, Microfauna, Herbivorous dinosaurs,
                    Metabolism.

                    The book will surely excite the interest of those with interests in natural history. We learn that
                    dinosaurs gradually replaced their proto-dinosaurian forerunners, benefitted from physiological
                    economies associated with gigantism, possessed metabolisms midway between “cold-blooded” and
                    “hot-blooded,” and gave rise to birds. These inferences reflect a current consensus among
                    paleontologists who study dinosaurs. The facts of dinosaurian life are presented with a zest only
                    exceeded by a spirited endorsement of environmental education in the epilogue. Many subthemes appear
                    along the way. Among them, the most fascinating are the incidents of discovery and insight,
                    stimulated by semi-arid landscapes in western Madagascar, migrating wildebeest herds in northern
                    Kenya, and the silent austerity of Californian redwood forests. Readers, like this reviewer, will be
                    delighted by little asides such as 90% of the cells in the human body are nonhuman, only 5% of a
                    tree is living, erosion would be a 1000 times more rapid on a lifeless Earth, and fungi defend
                    conifer needles from insect attack. The silhouettes depicting the size of various kinds of dinosaurs
                    in relation to that of humans are very informative. A glossary is provided, as well as an excellent
                    index. A compendium of notes at the volume’s end should not be overlooked as they contain
                    interesting, late-breaking information.
                    <br>
                    The author underscores conceptual milestones, or “paradigm shifts,” that promoted an understanding
                    of the character of the dinosaurian world. Hutton recognized the depth of geologic time, Darwin
                    understood the efficacy of natural selection, Wegener realized that continents slowly move, and
                    Hennig quantified the interrelationships of organisms. These intellectual tools breathed life into
                    fossilized skeletons, and produced an ongoing “dinosaurian renaissance” championed by Ostrom and
                    Bakker. Unlike some other accounts of dinosaurs, a time line does not dominate the text. The “Alpha”
                    of the dinosaurian era was a single bacterial cell that also marked the beginning of life on Earth;
                    its “Omega” was an extinction probably (but not certainly) caused by the impact of an asteroid.
                    Above all, the evolution of dinosaurs was driven by climates and continental drift across the
                    surface of a long enduring “hothouse” Earth. In fidelity to the author’s passion for dinosaurs, the
                    apex of his evolutionary saga is charmingly occupied by … a dinosaur (see figure 2.3)! For him,
                    outstanding attributes of evolution are cyclical or episodic and “systems within systems.” These are
                    illustrated by depictions of convection within the Earth (figure 4.2), the descent of dinosaurs
                    (figure 2.3), and biological energy flow during the Cretaceous (figure 5.1). In his “river of life,”
                    fluidity does not imply directionality, but rather continuity in evolution. Populations, not
                    individuals, evolve, but directional change is brief and does not accumulate. Humankind is
                    definitely not the culmination of evolution; bacteria remain the fundamental and ecologically most
                    important form of life.
